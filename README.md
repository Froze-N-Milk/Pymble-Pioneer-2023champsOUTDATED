# Pymble Pionner
A match scouting data collection platform for FRC team 6510 Pymble Pride, hosted on github pages.

Currently owned and maintained by Oscar Chevalier <oscar.chevalier@pymblelc.nsw.edu.au>
Contact me for information regarding the team or this app.

Progressively develops JSON or csv outputs of collected data, also attempting to produce a QR code of the most recent match for quick collection or analysis if desired.

Functions offline once loaded.

Note that inputs are not sanitised, nor do I currently wish to put the time into doing so, the assumption is that users will not attempt to break the system. Sanitisation will likely later be implemented for commas as their presence in the comments boxes will likely cause issues for the outputs.

Check the github sites deployment for the app itself.
